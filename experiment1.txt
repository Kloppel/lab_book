Cytochrome c Oxidase spectroscopy notes

01.05.24 
experiment #234 with par.den. cco, 5mM cco in colloid nanoparticles, 2ml solution, IR spectrum file: 010524_spec.ir 

02.05.24 
experiment #235, repeat of experiment #234, results similar, IR spectrum file: 020524_spec.ir

03.05.24
experiment #236, conditions like #234 and #235 but temperature increased from 18C to 25C, peaks in spectrum less defined than #234 #235, IR spectrum file: 030524_spec.ir

09.05.2024
experiment #237, conditions like #234 but additional chromatography before elution, IR spectrum file: 090524_spec.ir, cco peaks better distinguishable from solution peaks due to cleaner sample, repeat with higher temperature. 

10.05.24
experiment #238, conditions like #237 but with temperature like #236 at 25C instead of 18C, IR spectrum file: 100524_spec.ir.
